                                        to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
                                        and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
                                        the team they are supporting.</p>

                                        the location of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must
                                        remain within their team's bench area during the game.</p>

                <div class="details">
                    <p>The referee shall verify the identity of the players and coaches with his/her
                        player pass. He shall collect the passes of those players and coaches who
                        are to participate in the game. The referee must allow no player into the
                        game for whom he/she has no pass.</p>
                    <p>Upon completion of the game, the referee shall send his/her report to the
                        UYSA offices within four (4) days, holidays excluded. If a coach or a
                        player is ejected, the referee report form is required within forty-eight (48)
                        hours along with the player/coach pass.</p>
                    <p>A referee report form must be filed for every game played.</p>
                    <p>Each team must determine whether or not referees are registered prior to
                        the start of each game. Upon request, referees officiating at any game
                        must willingly and without bias, show documentation regarding their
                        certification level and registration standing with the USSF to coach,
                        assistant coach, or team captain of teams participating in that game. Prior
                        to the game a coach may decide to postpone the game if the referees do
                        not produce the requested documentation. The game is to be replayed at
                        a later date.</p>
                    <p>Referees not complying with this section will be referred to the Disciplinary
                        Committee.</p></div>
